#### Body Art

## The art of body building

The main motto of our project is to provide an website for all body builders that is providing them a different way of exercising other then just lifting weights and running on dreadmills.
The website's purpose is to provide people with both online way of signing up and showing people the different ways that we train which are both fun and have more benefits then your average local gym.
